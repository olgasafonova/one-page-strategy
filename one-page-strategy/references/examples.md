# One Page Strategy: Worked Examples

Two complete examples demonstrating the framework. Present the most relevant one when a user asks for an example.

## Example 1: Company Strategy (SaaS Inventory Management)

*A fictional SaaS business that helps retailers with inventory management, pivoting from enterprise to SMB.*

### The Facts

Our current customers are major retail chains, representing around 25% of the retail market but requiring complex integrations and extensive onboarding support. While these clients generate high contract value, their long sales cycles and demand for bespoke features limit our ability to scale. We face strong competition from competitors with deep ERP integrations we cannot match. Meanwhile, smaller retail chains (5-50 locations) and independent shops make up 60% of the retail market but are underserved by existing inventory management solutions. These smaller retailers face frequent stockouts or overstocking due to manual tracking or basic tools that fail to provide actionable insights.

> **Why this works**: Starts with customers. States specific numbers (25%, 60%). No subjective words. Establishes the tension between current customers and the underserved market. 168 words, 5 sentences.

### The Problem

Smaller retail chains and independent shops lack affordable, easy-to-use inventory management software tailored to their needs, leading to poor stock management, lost revenue, and wasted time.

> **Why this works**: One sentence. Root cause (lack of affordable software), not symptom (lost revenue). Customer-focused. Time-bound implicitly (these retailers need solutions now).

### The Idea

We believe that by creating a self-service inventory management platform with intuitive setup and affordable pricing, we can capture this underserved market segment and establish a scalable, high-volume revenue stream.

> **Why this works**: One sentence. States a testable belief. Directly addresses The Problem. Could be wrong (maybe SMBs won't switch from spreadsheets).

### The Solution

1. **Adopt a Tiered Pricing Model.** Introduce an entry-level plan for small chains and independents, scaling up based on the number of locations and SKUs.
2. **Shift Marketing Focus.** Test new positioning to target independent shop owners and small retail operators, emphasizing ease of use, affordability, and ROI.
3. **Stop Custom Development.** Pause custom feature development for enterprise clients to focus resources on the new self-service platform.
4. **Automate Onboarding.** Develop a guided, self-service onboarding process with in-app tutorials and easy integrations for common POS systems.
5. **Modularise the Platform.** Redesign with a simplified feature set for smaller retailers (real-time stock tracking, low-stock alerts, order predictions), turning advanced features into optional extras.

> **Why this works**: 5 bullets in sequence (pricing first enables market entry; marketing tests demand; stopping custom work frees resources; onboarding enables self-service; modularisation delivers the product). Includes what to stop (bullet 3). Action-focused, not aspirational.

## Example 2: Team Strategy (Partner Onboarding)

*Loosely based on a real situation in the Partner Onboarding team at a SaaS company. Includes inline discussion notes showing how disagreements were resolved during the alignment process.*

### The Facts

We have 38 partners in our onboarding backlog, up from 23 this time last year, and project around 50 by this time next year if nothing changes. We take an average of 18 months to onboard each partner (varying between 3 and 35 months) and have onboarded an average of 1.3 partners per month for the past 12 months. 19 partners are threatening to cancel their contracts. Most delays are due to partner-specific features we are contractually obligated to provide, and in many cases the original requestor has left the partner's organisation, so we cannot clarify the requirements. We have stopped adding custom requirements to new contracts but cannot onboard those new partners as they are at the end of our queue.

> **Discussion note**: The team had also lost 7 experienced members and replaced only 3 with junior hires. This was initially proposed as a key fact, but investigation showed the backlog moved no quicker when the team was larger. Including it would have led to a different (and less effective) Problem statement.

### The Problem

Most of these contractual obligations are no longer valid and we would not agree to them if we were negotiating these contracts now; if we didn't have them, we would not have an onboarding backlog.

> **Discussion note**: Reduced team capacity was the main alternative Problem proposed. But the data showed the backlog grew even with a larger team, so the root cause was the contracts, not the headcount.

### The Idea

We believe that if we renegotiate these partner contracts to exclude custom requirements, we can accelerate onboarding for each partner, and offering this accelerated onboarding would encourage them to renegotiate favourably.

> **Discussion note**: The sales manager initially suggested increasing onboarding capacity to meet existing obligations. After agreeing on The Facts and The Problem, the team agreed that more capacity wouldn't solve the root cause.

### The Solution

1. **Renegotiate Partnership Contracts.** Initiate renegotiations with partners who have custom requirements to agree on a standard integration. If custom requirements are unavoidable, specify them in a separate agreement.
2. **Delay Partners with Legacy Contracts.** Deprioritise legacy work so partners with standard integrations can be onboarded first. Accept that some partners may be lost due to additional delays.
3. **Split the Onboarding Team.** Set up a dedicated team for custom requirements so the core team can handle standard integrations rapidly.
4. **Market Fast Onboarding.** Use the speed of standard onboarding as case studies to persuade remaining partners to renegotiate.

> **Result**: The team began integrating a partner every two weeks. Other partners complained about slower onboarding. The team offered them the same speed if they dropped custom requirements. Most did.

## Using These Examples

When showing examples to users:

- **For company/product strategies**: Use Example 1 (SaaS inventory). Highlights market segmentation, competitive positioning, and product decisions.
- **For team/function strategies**: Use Example 2 (partner onboarding). Highlights internal process, contract constraints, and the alignment discussions that shaped each section.
- **To demonstrate the alignment process**: Use Example 2's discussion notes to show how disagreements at each stage were resolved.
